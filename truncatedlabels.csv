Compensation: To compensate you for the time you spend in this study, you will receive payment from Prolific upon completion of the survey. 
Employment questions or sensitive questions: We strongly advise that you do not use an employer issued electronic device, laptop, phone or WIFI to respond to this survey, as many employers monitor use of all devices.
